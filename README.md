For this project, I created a React-Typescript application using the Vite build tool. In organizing and structuring the application, I closely followed the Figma design provided. In order to quickly prototype the design, I chose the Tailwind CSS framework. This also allowed me to efficiently implement a responsive mobile design on top of the mockup. For testing I used the Jest framework along with the React Testing Library, with each component having its own suite of tests located in a dedicated test file.
